Our team's main goal is to ensure the timely completion of all assigned projects while aiming for good grades. We acknowledge potential challenges like conflicting schedules, communication issues, and mutual respect. We are committed to starting our work early to avoid settling for less than an "A," though we may consider this if all team members agree. While additional contributions from team members are acceptable, we prefer to avoid it and maintain a positive attitude and open communication.
In class time will be used to communicate along with short term goal setting, what each member needs to do. We will conduct group meetings once a week in person, otherwise zoom at 4 on friday. We will use Discord for general communication along with our snapchat group chat. 
If a team member misses meetings, we will address the issue, and if the behavior persists, we will involve the professor. Similarly, if someone fails to contribute during group discussions, we will address it internally and, if necessary, share the matter to the professor.
Each team member commits to dedicating at least 5 hours per week to project-related work. We aim to distribute tasks equitably, considering individual skill sets. Responsibilities and schedules will be documented for clarity. If tasks are not completed as agreed upon, it is acceptable as long as they are finished by the assignment's due date.
In cases of team members not fulfilling their commitments, we will reach out to address the issue. If the behavior persists, we will escalate the matter to the professor or TA. To make significant team decisions, we require an 80% agreement, meaning 4 out of 5 team members should be in agreement.
